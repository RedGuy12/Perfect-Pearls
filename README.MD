So I like GitHub's Issues/PRs/Forks system better than Glitch's instant-update system. I would have just use GitHub Pages, but they don't support PHP, Node.JS, or any other server-side programming language!

So, instead, I've decided to write a PHP script that pulls the files from a GitHub repository and execute them here.
