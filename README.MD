So I like GitHub's Issues/PRs/Forks system better than Glitch's instant-update system. I would have just use GitHub Pages, but they don't support PHP, Node.JS, or any other server-side programming language!

So, instead, I've decided to write a PHP script that pulls the files from a GitHub repository and host them here. You won't see the files on this view but you would [on the site view](https://perfect-pearls.glitch.me/) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/RedGuy12/perfect-pearls).
